isometry-prototype
==================

I'll be using this project to get a better grasp of the 2D isometric projection.

To do:
- [ ] implement a simple 2d grid
- [ ] display grid in normal carthesian coordinate system
- [ ] display grid in isometric projection
- [ ] detect touch location
- [ ] convert touch locations from screen space to isometric & vice versa
